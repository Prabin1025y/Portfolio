- **Bold** and *italic* text
- Lists and numbered items

- Links and images
- Blockquotes and more

### ⚡ Next.js Performance
Built on Next.js 14 with:
- Static site generation for fast loading
- Automatic optimization
- SEO-friendly URLs

### 🎨 Beautiful Styling
Clean, modern design with:
- Typography optimized for reading
- Responsive layout
- Syntax highlighting for code

## Code Example

Here's a simple JavaScript function:

```javascript
function greetReader(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}! Welcome to the blog!`;
}

console.log(greetReader("Developer"));
```

## Getting Started

To create your own posts:

1. Create `.mdx` files in the `content/posts` directory
2. Add frontmatter with title, date, and excerpt
3. Write your content using markdown
4. Your posts will automatically appear on the homepage

> **Pro tip:** You can include React components directly in your MDX files for interactive content!

Now that you have this blog set up, you can:

- Customize the styling to match your brand
- Add more MDX plugins for enhanced functionality
- Create custom React components for your posts
- Deploy to your favorite hosting platform

Happy blogging! 🚀
