Let's get started!

<span id="1-initialize-nextjs-project" />
## 1. Initialize a Next.js Project

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-mdx-page
cd my-mdx-page
npm install
```

<span id="2-install-dependencies" />
## 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install next-mdx-remote
```

`next-mdx-remote` is a powerful package that helps you use MDX (Markdown with JSX) in your Next.js applications. It allows you to:
- Write content in MDX format (combining Markdown with React components)
- Load and render MDX content dynamically
- Parse frontmatter (metadata at the top of MDX files)
- Use React components within your Markdown content

<span id="folder-structure" />
## Folder Structure

```bash
my-mdx-page/
├── src/
│   ├── app/
│   │   ├── layout.tsx
│   │   ├── page.tsx
│   │   └── post/
│   │       └── [slug]/
│   │           └── page.tsx
│   └── contents/
│       └── posts/
│           └── example-post.mdx
├── package.json
├── next.config.js
├── tailwind.config.ts
└── tsconfig.json
```

Let's understand the key parts of this structure:

1. `src/app/post/[slug]/page.tsx`:
   - The `[slug]` folder name uses Next.js dynamic routing
   - This is where we'll render our MDX pages

2. `src/contents/posts/`:
   - This is where all your MDX page files will live
   - Each `.mdx` file in this directory represents a page
   - The filename (without .mdx) will be used as the URL slug
   - For example, `example-post.mdx` will be accessible at `/post/example-post`

> **Important Note**: The `contents` folder and its structure is not created automatically by Next.js. You'll need to create these folders manually:
> ```bash
> mkdir -p src/contents/posts
> ```
> This is where you'll store all your MDX blog post files.

<span id="3-import-required-modules" />
## 3. Import Required Modules

```tsx showLineNumbers {4}
//blog/[slug]/page.tsx
import path from "path";
import {promises as fs} from "fs";
import { compileMDX } from "next-mdx-remote/rsc";
import { notFound } from "next/navigation";
```

Let's understand what each import does:

- `path`: Node.js built-in module which will be used to read the file path of our MDX files
- `fs`: Node.js file system module (using promises version) to read MDX files from the filesystem
- `compileMDX`: Core function from next-mdx-remote that compiles MDX content into React components and also parses the frontmatter
- `notFound`: Next.js utility to show 404 page when a blog post isn't found

<span id="what-is-frontmatter" />
### What is Frontmatter?

Frontmatter is metadata at the top of your MDX files, enclosed between `---` markers. It's commonly used to store information about your page like title, date, author, etc. Here's an example:

```mdx showLineNumbers {2-5}
---
title: "My First Post"
date: "2024-03-20"
author: "John Doe"
tags: ["Next.js", "MDX", "Web Development"]
---

# My First Post
This is the actual content of my post...
```

When this MDX file is compiled, the frontmatter will be available as a JavaScript object:
```js
{
  title: "My First Post",
  date: "2024-03-20",
  author: "John Doe",
  tags: ["Next.js", "MDX", "Web Development"]
}
```

<span id="4-blogpost-component" />
## 4. Post Component

```tsx showLineNumbers{5} {19-24}
//post/[slug]/page.tsx
export default async function Post({ params }: { params: Promise<{ slug: string }> }) {
  try {
    const resolvedParams = await params;

    if (!resolvedParams || !resolvedParams.slug) {
      notFound();
    }

    const { slug } = resolvedParams;

    // Read the MDX file with the help of path and fs module
    const fileContent = await fs.readFile(
      path.join(process.cwd(), "src/contents/posts", `${slug}.mdx`),
      "utf-8"
    );

    // Compile the MDX file with the help of compileMDX function
    const { content, frontmatter } = await compileMDX({
      source: fileContent,
      options: {
        parseFrontmatter: true,
      },
    });

    if (!fileContent) {
      notFound();
    }

    return (
      <article className="prose">
        <h1>{frontmatter.title}</h1>
        {content}
      </article>
    );
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
    //You can add toast here
    notFound();
  }
}
```

## 5. Styling with Tailwind Typography

But wait! Something's not quite right. Our pages look plain and unformatted. The markdown content isn't styled properly, and it doesn't have that polished, professional look we want. That's where Tailwind Typography comes to the rescue!

<span id="why-are-styles-reset" />
### Why Are Styles Reset?

By default, Tailwind CSS resets all default browser styles to ensure consistency across different browsers. This is great for building custom UIs, but it means our markdown content loses its default styling. That's why our pages initially look unstyled - we need to explicitly tell Tailwind how to style our markdown content.

### What is Tailwind Typography?
Tailwind Typography is a plugin that provides beautiful typographic defaults to any vanilla HTML. It's perfect for styling markdown content because it:

- Automatically styles all your markdown elements (headings, lists, blockquotes, etc.)
- Provides consistent spacing and typography
- Works seamlessly with dark mode
- Is highly customizable

<span id="installation" />
### Installation

```bash
npm install -D @tailwindcss/typography
```

Then add it to your `tailwind.config.ts`:

```ts showLineNumbers {2} /typography/3
//tailwind.config.ts
import typography from '@tailwindcss/typography'

export default {
  // ...other config
  plugins: [typography],
}
```

<span id="usage" />
### Usage

The most important part is adding the `prose` class to your article element. Without this class, none of the typography styles will be applied:

```tsx showLineNumbers /prose/ {3}
//blog/[slug]/page.tsx
<article className="prose">
  {content}
</article>
```

> **Important**: The `prose` class is required! It's the key that unlocks all the typography styles. Without it, your markdown content will remain unstyled.

The `prose` class will automatically style:
- Headings (h1-h6)
- Paragraphs
- Lists (ordered and unordered)
- Blockquotes
- Code blocks
- Tables
- And more!

<span id="customization-optional" />
### Customization (Optional)

You can customize the typography styles in your `tailwind.config.ts`:

```ts showLineNumbers {8-9, 15-16}
//tailwind.config.ts
theme: {
  extend: {
    typography: {
      DEFAULT: {
        css: {
          // Light mode styles
          '--tw-prose-body': theme('colors.gray.800'),
          '--tw-prose-headings': theme('colors.gray.900'),
        },
      },
      dark: {
        css: {
          // Dark mode styles
          '--tw-prose-body': theme('colors.gray.300'),
          '--tw-prose-headings': theme('colors.white'),
        },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

<span id="example" />
### Example

Let's walk through the complete process of creating and viewing a page:

1. **Create the Page**
```bash
# Create the posts directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p src/contents/posts
   
# Create your MDX file
touch src/contents/posts/my-first-post.mdx
```

2. **Write Your Content**

````mdx showLineNumbers
// contents/posts/my-first-post.mdx
---
title: "Hello, MDX World!"
date: "2024-03-20"
author: "Your Name"
tags: ["MDX", "Next.js", "Tailwind"]
---

# Welcome to My First MDX Post

This is a sample post to demonstrate how MDX and Tailwind Typography work together.

## Features We're Using

- **Markdown** for content
- **MDX** for React components
- **Tailwind Typography** for styling

### Code Example

Here's a simple React component we can use in our MDX:

```tsx
function Greeting({ name }: { name: string }) {
  return <h2>Hello, {name}!</h2>
}
```

### Blockquotes

> This is a blockquote. It's styled automatically by Tailwind Typography!

### Lists

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

- Unordered list
- With multiple items
- And proper spacing

### Tables

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| MDX | Markdown with JSX |
| Typography | Beautiful text styling |
| Dark Mode | Automatic dark mode support |
````

3. **View Your Post**
   - Start your development server: `npm run dev{:bash}`
   - Visit: `http://localhost:3000/post/my-first-post`

4. **What's Happening Behind the Scenes**
   - When you visit `/post/my-first-post`:
     1. Next.js matches the URL to your `[slug]` dynamic route
     2. The `Post` component reads the MDX file
     3. `next-mdx-remote` compiles the MDX content
     4. Tailwind Typography styles the content with the `prose` class

<span id="5-common-issues-and-solutions" />
5. **Common Issues and Solutions**
   - **Post not found?** Check if:
     - The file exists in `src/contents/posts`
     - The filename matches the URL slug
     - The file extension is `.mdx`
   - **Styles not applying?** Verify:
     - The `prose` class is added to your article element
     - Tailwind Typography is installed and configured
     - Your `tailwind.config.ts` includes the typography plugin
     - Your `global.css` include all three `base`, `components`, `utilities` of tailwindcss

## Thats it!

You've successfully set up a modern MDX page with Next.js! You now have:

- A powerful page system that combines the best of Markdown and React
- Beautiful typography that makes your content shine
- A solid foundation for building more features
